## Phillip A. Raywood
### Analyst, Developer, Engineer
#### Las Vegas, Nevada


I began my studies in an engineering program at Georgia State University's, Georgia Perimeter College in Atlanta, GA.  I later switched over to a Mathematics program.  During that time, I entered the business world on the phones.  First, answering customer service calls at an insurance company and later dialing out to small, medium, large enterprises with marketing communications for a vendor of database server technology and digitization solutions.  Speaking with smart people about their intentions with the products I was marketing became an inspiration to the world of working with data.  Since, I have served the banking, healthcare, technology, and insurance industries within the functions of strategic planning, analytics, and engineering.
