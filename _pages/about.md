## Phillip A. Raywood
### Analyst, Developer, Engineer
#### Las Vegas, Nevada


Phillip models operational outcomes as a function past observation. With this, we have a hypothetical model to understand how maintaining leading measurables at a certain level will help achieve predictable operational results. His experience is rooted in predictive modeling, prototyping of reporting tools and pre-implementation strategy experimentation on test-groups, but also reporting, business intelligence, and programming.
