        "What are we talking about here?  [Data Structures](https://towardsdatascience.com/8-common-data-structures-every-programmer-must-know-171acf6a1a42) are a specialized means of organizing and storing data in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the stored data more efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Early in my coding career, I discovered that in the programming world, we abstract data in a structure that can be represented as class object nodes.  Specifically, while on assignment at Bank of America Merchant services by direction of my superior, I did some deep diving into MS SQL online transactional processing relational database engines and how they work.  Internally, this particular product would rely upon applying algorithims to a data structure called a B-tree.  Shout out to Itzik Ben-Gan, who wrote some literature that became foundational to my understanding of relational database management engines.  My boss at BAMS happened to be involved with the technical review of Itzik's popular literature.  These books were strongly recommended during my project onboarding.  I have these books close by to date via Kindle.\n",
        "\n",
        "B-trees as an astraction of data, presented themselves to me as difficult to comprehend.  Before learning of them, my world consisted of tables or views: database objects that we may imagine as behaving like a spreadsheet.  The table object in my in my mind's eye was revealed as an abstract way to view B-trees, underneath.\n",
        "\n",
        "These B-tree structures and the algorithims that are applied to them are abstracted away from the analyst or administrator working in the database by means of structured query language or SQL.  This opened up the natural observation that it would be critical for me to understand more about data structures if I want to go a layer deeper than the SQL [abstractions](https://www.sqlshack.com/sql-server-index-structure-and-concepts/#:~:text=The%20B%2DTree%20structure%20provides,all%20the%20underlying%20table%20rows.).  All of the sudden, there was more to the universe than user defined functions, procedures, and table objects.  B-trees and their \"pages\" are a variant of binary search trees, a node-based binary tree data structure."

Outside of the deprecated queue, I have hardly see custom structures in production during my career.  In 2018, I learned how to build an algorithim that functions in traversing a linked list in fear that it would come up one day in a technical interview.  To this day, it never has.\n",

I'm not going to spend time on those here.  We've spent some time working with them in previous posts, already.  Remember we just want the bottom line up front when it comes to the mysterious prerequisites for working with GNN's.  I will say before learning minimal nuances, my experiences in working with arrays and hash table like structures are rooted in JavaScript front end development and backend development with Django, .NET, nodeJS.  To that end, I was first exposed to hash tables before gaining object oriented experience by way of witnessing the `HASH JOIN` SQL operation at BAMS and following up with Itzik's literature.\n",

I figure if we want to get to the good stuff, we need to at least cover the basics for how some of these internal mechanics of ML training and prediction processes function.  Let's also state the application of data structures and algorithims extend far beyond machine learning."
